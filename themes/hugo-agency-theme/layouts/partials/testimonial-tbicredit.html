        <h4 class="section-subheading">TBI Credit approves applications 30 times faster after implementing Charisma Credit. The speed in credit approval is TBI Creditâ€™s biggest competitive advantage.</h4>
        <p>TBI Credit offers personal loans in Romania. Before automating operations, the company handled 200 credit applications a month. In 2003, it installed Charisma. Now, the member of TBFI Financial Services handles 200 applications each day.
"Our 50 stores run on Charisma", explains Traian Baicu, general manager at TBI Credit. "The back and front-office solutions from TotalSoft simplified operations and boosted our sales."
Charisma automated credit file management, risk analysis and accounting. With the system, store managers also complete a new credit application in about 5 minutes.
"Charisma Credit made us 30 times faster. The speed of our credit approval is our main competitive advantage", concludes Baicu.</p>

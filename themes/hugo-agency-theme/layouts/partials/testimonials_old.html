            <h4>Raiffeisen Leasing uses Charisma Leasing in 3 countries.</h4>
            <p class="text-muted"  style="font-size:14px;">In 2003, Raiffeisen Leasing decided to automate its lease management. First, the subsidiaries in Albania and Bulgaria automated routine tasks in accounting, risk and lease management. Operations became more efficient. And, as a consequence, Raiffeisen Leasing strengthened its position in Central Eastern Europe. Raiffeisen Leasing subsidiary in Romania was the next to try Charisma. The third implementation was going to be complex. "Charisma is spectacular. It evolve to support our business", says Robert Pintilie, vice-president at Raiffeisen Leasing in Romania.</p>

            <h4>TotalSoft implemented Charisma at GE Capital within 8 months.</h4>
            <p class="text-muted"  style="font-size:14px;">Industry-focused ERPs equal bespoke solutions in function and flexibility. GE Capital can attest to it. Following the leasing boom in 2005, the company entered the Romanian market. It partnered with TotalSoft, using our industry-focused ERP to automate operations. "Charisma met the needs of our company. That is a considerable feat, as we weren't your usual leasing business. Leasing companies tend to have a small number of high value contracts. At GE Capital, we managed a large number of low value contracts. We also had credit contracts", explains Radu Burghelea, CIO at GE Capital.</p>
